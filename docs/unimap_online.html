&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UniMap application has online connectors to upload/download/browse images and analysis data associated to an online collaboration site.
At the moment there is just a very basic web interface available at: <a href="http://unimap.larryo.org">unimap.larryo.org</a>. To login you must use the username/password setup under the <i>Menu->Options->Online</i> section. As for now the online interface only show you a gallery like set of pages - allowing you to browse your images.

<li> You can upload image to the online collaboration site by either using the option <i>Menu->Image->Upload</i> or action the upload toolbar button. When the upload takes place all image data is loaded remotely and icons and previews are generated. On the site the data is keep in a files system as well as mysql database for the ease of searching.
<br><br>
<li> The online browsing dialog will allow you to either browse or search the online images by given criteria. A preview if show in the right side of the window. From there you can download images and astrometry data locally. Also you can rate the online images by three criteria: quality, artistic and relevance. You can access the browsing window from either <i>Menu->File->Online->Browse</i> or the toolbar button.
<br><br>
<li> Also, in order to easy the bug reporting, suggestions/ideas and future request I added a simple dialog window through which the user can submit his case.  The information is stored in a database which makes it easier to track and update the state of each issue.
