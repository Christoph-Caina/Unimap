This machine-readable SAO catalog from the Astronomical Data Center is
based on an original binary version of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory Star Catalog (SAO, SAO Staff 1966). Subsequent
improvements by T. A. Nagy (1979) included the addition of equatorial
coordinates in radians and cross-identifications from the Table of
Correspondences SAO/HD/DM/GC (Morin 1973). As a prelude to creation of
the 1984 version of the SAO, a new version of the SAO-HD-GC-DM Cross
Index was prepared (Roman, Warren, and Schofield 1983). The 1984
version of the SAO contained the corrected and extended cross
identifications, all errata published up to January 1984 and known to
the ADC, numerous errors forwarded to the ADC by colleagues, and
errors discovered at the ADC during the course of this work. Clayton
A. Smith of the U. S. Naval Observatory provided J2000.0 positions and
proper motions for the SAO stars. Published and unpublished errors
discovered in the previous version (1984) have been corrected (up to
May 1991). The catalog contains SAO number; the right ascension and
declination with a B1950.0 equinox and epoch; annual proper motion and
its standard deviation, photographic and visual magnitudes; spectral
type; references to sources; the Durchmusterung (DM) identifier if the
star is listed in the Bonner DM (BD), Cordoba DM (CD), or Cape
Photographic DM (CP); component identification; The Henry Draper
(Extension) (HD or HDE) number; and J2000 positions and proper
motions. Multiple-star component identifications have been added to
stars where more than one SAO entry has the same DM number. The Henry
Draper Extension (HDE) numbers have been added for stars found in both
volumes of the extension. Data for duplicate SAO entries (those
referring to the same star) have been flagged. J2000 positions in
usual units and in radians have been added.

The Hipparcos Input Catalogue was constructed as the observing program
for ESA's Hipparcos astrometry mission. This has resulted in a
catalogue of stellar data including up-to-date information on
positions, proper motions, magnitudes, colors, and when available,
spectral types, radial velocities, multiplicity and variability
information. The catalogue is complete to well-defined magnitude
limits, and includes a substantial sampling of the most important
stellar categories present in the solar neighbourhood beyond these
limits. The magnitude limits vary from 7.3 to 9 magnitudes as a
function of galactic latitude and spectral type, and there are no
stars fainter than about V = 13 mag.

118000 stars are included in the Hipparcos Input Catalogue, about half
of them have been selected within well-defined limits in V magnitude,
spectral type and galactic latitude (the "survey"), half of them
within proposed observing programs. The mean accuracies achieved, as
demonstrated by comparison with the Hipparcos results (Turon et al.
1995A&A...304...82T) are 0.3 arcsec for the positions and 0.25 mag for
the Hp magnitude, with accuracies of 0.02 mag or better for more than
a third of the catalogue.

The data set consists of the main catalogue, and the first supplement
which contains more detailed information for multiple system
components. Other supplements with identification charts can be found
in the published version.

A complete description is provided, either as a LaTeX file (intro.tex),
or as a plain ascii file (intro.cat).

The Tycho-2 Catalogue is an astrometric reference catalogue containing
positions  and proper motions  as well as  two-colour photometric data
for the 2.5 million brightest stars in the sky.  The Tycho-2 positions
and magnitudes are  based on  precisely the  same observations  as the
original  Tycho  Catalogue  (hereafter  Tycho-1;  see  Cat.  I/239))
collected  by the  star mapper  of the  ESA Hipparcos  satellite,  but
Tycho-2 is much bigger  and slightly  more precise,   owing to  a more
advanced   reduction  technique.   Components  of  double  stars  with
separations down to 0.8 arcsec are included. Proper motions precise to
about 2.5 mas/yr are given as  derived  from  a  comparison  with  the
Astrographic   Catalogue  and   143  other   ground-based  astrometric
catalogues,  all reduced to the Hipparcos celestial coordinate system.
Tycho-2  supersedes in most applications Tycho-1,   as well as the ACT
(Cat.  I/246)  and TRC  (Cat. I/250)  catalogues based on Tycho-1.
Supplement-1  lists stars  from the  Hipparcos and  Tycho-1 Catalogues
which are not in Tycho-2.  Supplement-2 lists 1146 Tycho-1 stars which
are probably either false or heavily disturbed.

The  Naval Observatory Merged  Astrometric  Dataset  (NOMAD)  contains
astrometric and photometric data for over 1 billion stars derived from
the Hipparcos (I/239), Tycho-2 (I/259),  UCAC2 (I/289),  and USNO-B1.0
(I/284)  catalogs for astrometry and optical photometry,  supplemented
by 2MASS (II/246)  near-infrared photometry.  For each unique star the
"best"   astrometric and photometric  data are chosen  from the source
catalogs and merged into a single dataset. A sequence of priorities is
followed  and NOMAD contains flags to identify the source catalogs and
gives cross-reference identifications.  This first release of NOMAD is
not a compiled catalog; that is,  if a star is identified in more than
1 of the  above mentioned catalogs,   only 1 catalog  entry is chosen.
Thus  the local  and global  systematic errors  of the  various source
catalogs will be present in this version of NOMAD. All source catalogs
astrometric  data are on the  International Celestial Reference System
within the  limitations of the source  catalogs.

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) project is designed to close the
gap between our current technical capability and our knowledge of the
near-infrared sky. In addition to providing a context for the
interpretation of results obtained at infrared and other wavelengths,
2MASS will provide direct answers to immediate questions on the
large-scale structure of the Milky Way and the Local Universe.

To achieve these goals, 2MASS is uniformly scanning the entire sky in
three near-infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources
brighter than about 1 mJy in each band, with signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) greater than 10, using a pixel size of 2.0". This will achieve
an 80,000-fold improvement in sensitivity relative to earlier surveys.

2MASS uses two new, highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt.
Hopkins, AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope is equipped with a
three-channel camera, each channel consisting of a 256x256 array of
HgCdTe detectors, capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J
(1.25 µm), H (1.65 µm), and Ks (2.17 µm), to a 3s
limiting sensitivity of 17.1, 16.4 and 15.3mag in the three bands.

The 2MASS arrays image the sky while the telescopes scan smoothly in
declination at a rate of ~1' per second. The 2MASS data "tiles" are 6
deg. long in the declination direction and one camera frame (8.5')
wide. The camera field-of-view shifts by ~1/6 of a frame in
declination from frame-to-frame. The camera images each point on the
sky six times for a total integration time of 7.8 s, with sub-pixel
"dithering", which improves the ultimate spatial resolution of the
final Atlas Images.

The University of Massachusetts (UMass) is responsible for the overall
management of the project, and for developing the infrared cameras and
on-site computing systems at both facilities. The Infrared Processing
and Analysis Center (IPAC) is responsible for all data processing
through the Production Pipeline, and construction and distribution of
the data products. The 2MASS project involves the participation of
members of the Science Team from several different institutions. The
2MASS project is funding by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

The GSC II is an all-sky catalog based on 1" resolution scans of the
photographic Sky Survey plates, at two epochs and three bandpasses,
from the Palomar and UK Schmidt telescopes (DSS). Positions,
magnitudes, and classifications are produced for all objects on each
plate. The objects are then loaded into the COMPASS database, where
multiple observations of the same object are matched and assigned a
unique name.

The GSC2.3 has no magnitude limit. The parameters of the bright
objects, overexposed on the Schmidt plates, are taken from the Tycho-2
(I/259) catalog. The computed proper motions are not yet publically
available because of 10mas/year systematic errors discovered for the
southern hemisphere that are still under investigation.

The Messier objects are a set of astronomical objects catalogued by Charles Messier in his 
"Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles" ("Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters"), 
originally published in 1771, with the last addition (based on Messier's observations) made 
in 1966. Because Messier was interested in finding only comets, he created a list of non-comet 
objects that frustrated his hunt for them. The Messier catalogue of objects is one of the 
most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many Messier objects are still referenced 
by their Messier number.

The first edition included 45 objects, with Messier's final list totalling 103 objects. 
Other astronomers, using side notes in Messier's texts, eventually filled out the list 
to 110 objects.

We present the new catalog of principal galaxies (PGC2003). It
constitutes the framework of the HYPERLEDA database that supersedes
the LEDA one, with more data and more capabilities. The catalog is
still restricted to confirmed galaxies, i.e. about one million
galaxies, brighter than ~18B-mag.

In order to provide the best possible identification for each galaxy
we give: accurate coordinates (typical accuracy better than 2 arcsec),
diameter, axis ratio and position angle. Diameters and axis ratios
have been homogenized to the RC2 system at the limiting surface
brightness of 25B-mag/arcsec2, using a new method, the EPIDEMIC
method.

In order to provide the best designation for each galaxy, we collected
the names from 50 catalogues. The compatibility of the spelling is
tested against NED and SIMBAD, and, as far as possible we used a
spelling compatible with both. For some cases, where no consensus
exists between NED, SIMBAD and LEDA, we propose some changes that
could make the spelling of names fully compatible.

The full catalog is distributed through the CDS and can be extracted
from HYPERLEDA, http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/

The Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies (UGC) is an essentially
complete catalogue of galaxies to a limiting diameter of 1.0' and/or
to a limiting apparent magnitude of 14.5 on the blue prints of the
Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS). Coverage is limited to the sky
north of declination -02.5degrees. Galaxies smaller than 1.0' in
diameter but brighter than 14.5 mag may be included from the Catalogue
of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies (CGCG, Zwicky et al.
1961-1968); all such galaxies in the CGCG are included in the UGC. The
galaxies are ordered by 1950 right ascension.

The catalogue contains descriptions of the galaxies and their
surrounding areas, plus conventional system classifications and
position angles for flattened galaxies. Galaxy diameters on both the
blue and red POSS prints are included and the classifications and
descriptions are given in such a way as to provide as accurate an
account as possible of the appearance of the galaxies on the prints.
Only the data portion of the published UGC is included in the
machine-readable version.

The order of the records is strictly by UGC number; i.e., the Addenda
records follow their main catalogue counterparts in the file. The
colons (indicating uncertainty) and various other codes (parentheses,
brackets) are not included in the machine-readable version of the
catalogue. Several possible improvements to the catalogue might
consist of adding codes corresponding to the published version, a
second file containing abbreviations and terminology and a third file
with the extensive notes. It would also be important to add an
asterisk or some other code to data records having a note in the
proposed third file.

This document describes the machine-readable version of the UGC as
distributed by the Astronomical Data Centers. It is intended to enable
users to read and process the data without problems or guesswork. For
additional details regarding the classifications, measurement of
apparent magnitudes, and data content, the source reference should be
consulted. A copy of this document should accompany any
machine-readable copy of the catalogue.

The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC) is a 37.5deg2, medium-deep,
B-band imaging survey along the celestial equator, taken with the Wide
Field Camera on the Isaac Newton Telescope. The survey region is
contained within the regions of both the Two Degree Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data
Release (SDSS-EDR). The survey has a uniform isophotal detection limit
of 26mag.arcsec-2 and it provides a robust, well-defined catalogue
of stars and galaxies in the range 16<=BMGC<24 mag.

Here we describe the survey strategy, the photometric and astrometric
calibration, source detection and analysis, and present the galaxy
number counts that connect the bright and faint galaxy populations
within a single survey. We argue that these counts represent the state
of the art and use them to constrain the normalizations (f*) of a
number of recent estimates of the local galaxy luminosity function. We
find that the 2dFGRS, SDSS Commissioning Data (CD), ESO Slice Project,
Century Survey, Durham/UKST, Mt Stromlo/APM, SSRS2 and NOG luminosity
functions require a revision of their published f* values by
factors of 1.05±0.05, 0.76±0.10, 1.02±0.22, 1.02±0.16,
1.16±0.28, 1.75±0.37, 1.40±0.26 and 1.01±0.39, respectively.
After renormalizing the galaxy luminosity functions we find a mean
local bJ luminosity density of 1.986±0.031x108h L?.Mpc-3

This is the Dixon Master List of Radio Sources

The Master List of Radio Sources (MSL) has been prepared by combining
about thirty catalogues in a common format. Approcimately 25000
listings are included for some 12000 separate sources.

Notice that this is a list of observations, not of individual sources, 
and that an entry in this table corresponds to an observation of a 
radio source at a particular frequency from a particular source catalog: 
also, no attempt was made by the author to use the same name for the 
same source, e.g., the source 3C 273 appears more than a dozen times 
under a variety of names such as PKS 1226+02, NRAO400, CTA 53, etc.

The VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) is a 74MHz (4m) continuum
survey covering the entire sky north of -30° declination. Using
the VLA in B- and BnA-configurations, we will map the entire survey
region at a resolution of 80" and with an average rms noise of 0.1
Jy/beam. For a detailed description of the survey and its scientific
motivations, please see the original proposal to the NRAO skeptical
review committee.

The VLSS is being made as a service to the astronomical community,
and the principal data products are being released to the public as
soon as they are produced and verified. Details and access to the
images can be found at http://lwa.nrl.navy.mil/VLSS/

The NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) is a radio continuum survey covering
the sky north of -40° declination at 1.4GHz. The principal data
products of the NVSS are a set of 2326 4x4° continuum "cubes" with
three planes containing Stokes I, Q, and U images, plus a catalog of
almost 2 million discrete sources stronger than a flux density of
about 2.5mJy.

The images all have 45 arcsecond FWHM angular resolution and nearly
uniform sensitivity. Their rms brightness fluctuations are
approximately 0.45mJy/beam=0.14K (Stokes I) and 0.29mJy/beam=0.09K
(Stokes Q and U). The rms uncertainties in right ascension and
declination vary from <= ~1arcsecond for the 400,000 sources stronger
than 15mJy to 7arcseconds at the survey limit.

A more detailed description is provided in the printed paper and at the
NVSS website at           http://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/
where all data products, user software, and updates were released as
soon as they were produced and verified.

The ROSAT All-Sky Survey Faint Source Catalogue (RASS-FSC) is derived
from the all-sky survey performed during the ROSAT mission in the
energy band 0.1-2.4 keV. 105,924 sources are catalogued and represent
the faint extension to the RASS bright source catalogue (RASS-BSC,
1999A&A...349..389V, See Cat. IX/10). The sources have a detection
likelihood of at least 7 and contain at least 6 source photons. (The
likelihood of source detection is defined as L = -ln(1-P), with
P = probability of source detection).

For each source we provide the ROSAT name, the position in equatorial
coordinates, the positional error, the source countrate and error, the
background countrate, exposure time, date of observation,
hardness-ratios HR1 and HR2 and errors, extent and likelihood of
extent, and likelihood of detection.

During a scan of the archival BATSE daily records covering the entire
9.1yr (TJD 8369-11690) of the BATSE operation, 3906 gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) have been detected. 2068 of these GRBs are previously known
BATSE triggers, while 1838 of them are new nontriggered bursts. It is
important that all events were detected in the same type of data and
were processed with the same procedure. Therefore these 3906 GRBs
constitute a uniform sample. We have created a publicly available
electronic data base
(http://www.astro.su.se/groups/head/grb_archive.html) containing this
sample. We describe the procedures of the data reduction, the
selection of the GRB candidates, and the statistical tests for
possible non-GRB contaminations. We also describe a novel test burst
method used to measure the scan efficiency and the information
obtained using the test bursts. Our scan decreases the BATSE detection
threshold to ~0.1photon/s/cm2. As a first result, we show that the
differential logN-logP distribution corrected for the detection
efficiency extends to low brightnesses without any indication of a
turnover. Any reasonable extrapolation of the new logN-logP to lower
brightnesses imply a rate of several thousands of GRBs in the universe
per year.

We describe the INTEGRAL reference catalog which classifies previously
known bright X-ray and gamma-ray sources before the launch of
INTEGRAL. These sources are, or have been at least once, brighter than
~1mCrab above 3keV, and are expected to be detected by INTEGRAL. This
catalog is being used in the INTEGRAL Quick Look Analysis to discover
new sources or significantly variable sources. We compiled several
published X-ray and gamma-ray catalogs, and surveyed recent
publications for new sources. Consequently, there are 1122 sources in
our INTEGRAL reference catalog. In addition to the source positions,
we show an approximate spectral model and expected flux for each
source, based on which we derive expected INTEGRAL counting rates.
Assuming the default instrument performances and at least ~105s
exposure time for any part of the sky, we expect that INTEGRAL will
detect at least ~700 sources below 10keV and ~400 sources above 20keV
over the mission life.

%Desc_START
The  2XMMi catalogue is the fourth  publicly released XMM X-ray source
catalogue produced by the XMM Survey Science Centre (SSC)  consortium,
following the 1XMM (Cat. IX/37,  released in April 2003),  2XMMp (July
2006)   and 2XMM (Cat.  IX/39,  August 2007)  catalogues:  2XMMp was a
preliminary  version of 2XMM.  2XMMi is  an incremental version of the
2XMM catalogue.

The 2XMMi catalogue is about 17% larger than the 2XMM catalogue, which
it supersedes,  due to the  1-year  longer  baseline  of  observations
included (it is about  8 times  larger than  the 1XMM  catalogue).  As
such,  it  is  the  largest  X-ray  source  catalogue  ever  produced,
containing  more than  twice as  many discrete  sources as  either the
ROSAT  survey or pointed catalogues.  2XMMi complements deeper Chandra
and XMM-Newton small  area surveys,  probing  a large sky  area at the
flux  limit where the bulk of the objects that contribute to the X-ray
background lie.  The 2XMMi catalogue  provides  a  rich  resource  for
generating large, well-defined samples for specific studies, utilizing
the fact that X-ray selection is a highly efficient (arguably the most
efficient)   way of selecting certain types of object,  notably active
galaxies (AGN), clusters of galaxies, interacting compact binaries and
active   stellar  coronae.   The   large  sky  area   covered  by  the
serendipitous survey, or equivalently the large size of the catalogue,
also means  that 2XMMi is a superb  resource for exploring the variety
of the X-ray source population and identifying rare source types.

The production of the 2XMMi  catalogue  has  been  undertaken  by  the
XMM-Newton  SSC   consortium  in  fulfilment  of   one  of  its  major
responsibilities   within  the  XMM-Newton   project.   The  catalogue
production process has been designed to exploit fully the capabilities
of the XMM-Newton EPIC cameras and to ensure the integrity and quality
of the resultant catalogue through rigorous screening of the data.

The predecessor 2XMM catalogue  was  made  from  a  subset  of  public
observations emerging  from a  re-processing (in  2006/7)  of  all XMM
observations made prior to that point. The creation of the incremental
2XMMi catalogue has been driven by  the  desire  to  make  public  the
additional data  from that re-processing that  were proprietary at the
time  of the 2XMM release but  which subsequently became public before
01 May 2008.  These have been augmented with a further 90 observations
that have been  processed  more  recently  as  part  of  the  routine,
day-to-day  XMM data processing performed by the SSC,  which were also
public  at 01  May 2008.   Together,  these  amount to  626 additional
observations (18%) with respect to 2XMM. With these new data,  the sky
area covered grows by 19%  while the number of detections increases by
17%  and  the number of  unique sources by  15%.  A key  factor in the
decision  to make the 2XMMi catalogue  is the fact that,  effectively,
all the new  data have been  processed with the  same science analysis
software (SAS), pipeline and calibration as used in the aforementioned
re-processing.   As such,   the products  from 2XMM  and from  the new
observations form a set of uniformly processed data. With software and
calibration changes now  being  propagated  into  the  SSC  processing
pipeline,   it was deemed timely to  make public the largest available
uniform catalogue.

The catalogue in its FITS version file (2xmmi.fit)  has 246897 entries
made of 297 columns;  a 'slim'  version gathering the 39 most relevant
columns for  the 191870 unique  sources detected,  is  available as an
ascii table or a FITS binary table. In both versions,  the columns are
fully   described  in  the  XMM-Newton   User  Guide  available  from:
http://xmmssc-www.star.le.ac.uk/Catalogue/UserGuide_xmmcat.html    The
original names of these columns  are  included  in  the  "Byte-by-byte
Description" below (uppercase names within parentheses)

The  HEAO A-1 X-Ray  Source Catalog is  a compilation of  data for 842
sources  detected with the U. S.  Naval Research Laboratory Large Area
Sky  Survey Experiment  flown aboard  the HEAO  1 satellite.  The data
include source identifications, positions,  error  boxes,  mean  X-ray
intensities, and cross identifications to other source designations.

The primary  objective of  the Naval  Research Laboratory  (NRL) Large
Area Sky  Survey Experiment (LASS)  flown aboard the  HEAO 1 satellite
was to conduct  an all-sky survey  for the brightest  X-ray sources in
the energy  range 0.25 to 25 keV.  The instrumentation consisted of an
array of  large  proportional  counter  modules  with  collimators  of
varying fields of view  and  with  sufficient  sensitivity  to  detect
sources as faint as 0.25 mu.Jy at 5 keV, assuming a Crab-like spectrum
(1.1 muJy at 5 keV =  1  UFU  for  a  Crab-like  spectrum).  Full  sky
coverage was achieved  in  the  first  6  months  of  the  mission  by
continuously scanning great circles  perpendicular  to  the  Earth-Sun
line.  The HEAO A-1 catalog results from the 6-month survey and, thus,
covers  the whole sky.  For additional information  concerning the NRL
LASS instrument, the data  analysis  procedures,  characteristics  and
limitations of the source data,  and  a  discussion  of  X-ray  source
classes, the source publication should be consulted.

We describe the Sternberg Astronomical Institute (SAI) catalog of
supernovae. We show that the radial distributions of type-Ia, type-Ibc
and type-II supernovae differ in the central parts of spiral galaxies
and are similar in their outer regions, while the radial distribution
of type-Ia supernovae in elliptical galaxies differs that in spiral
and lenticular galaxies. We give a list a supernovae that are farthest
from the galactic centers, estimate their relative expulsion rate, and
discuss their possible origins.

The current version contains data on 2780 extragalactic supernovae
(SNe) discovered from 1885 until January 6, 2004 and on their parent
galaxies. SNe are ordered by Right Ascension of their parent galaxies.
Data for parent galaxies were compiled from the following catalogues:
  RC3 (de Vaucouleurs et al., 1991, Cat. VII/155);
  UGC (Nilson, 1973. Cat.  VII/26);
  PGC (Paturel et al., 1989, Cat. VII/119);
  MCG (Vorontsov-Velyaminov et al., 1962-1968, Cat. VII/62, VII/100);
  ESO (Lauberts, 1982, Cat.  VII/34);
  CfA (Huchra et al., 1994, see Cat VII/193), and from
  van den Bergh (1994, Cat. J/ApJS/92/219).
Main source of morphological types, major diameters and axial ratios
was the RC3; the data from other sources have been reduced to the
system of RC3. Photographic magnitudes of galaxies were adopted from
the UGC and the PGC together with individual data from the literature.
The sources of recession velocities or cz values were the RC3, the
CfA, the PGC and IAU Circulars. Position angles were taken from the
RC3, UGC and the ESO catalogues, and inclination angles were mainly
derived from data in RC3 according to Holmberg (1958MeLu2.136....1H).
Some data for SNe and parent galaxies were adopted from GCVS
(Samus et al., 1995, Cat. II/205)

We derived the black hole fundamental plane relationship between the
1.4GHz radio luminosity (Lr), 0.1-2.4keV X-ray luminosity (LX), and
black hole mass (M) from a uniform broad-line SDSS AGN sample
including both radio-loud and radio-quiet X-ray-emitting sources. We
found in our sample that the fundamental plane relation has a very
weak dependence on the black hole mass, and a tight correlation also
exists between the Eddington-luminosity-scaled X-ray and radio
luminosities for the radio-quiet subsample. In addition, we noticed
that the radio-quiet and radio-loud AGNs have different power-law
slopes in the radio-X-ray nonlinear relationship. The radio-loud
sample displays a slope of 1.39, which seems consistent with the
jet-dominated X-ray model. However, it may also be partly due to the
relativistic beaming effect. For the radio-quiet sample the slope of
the radio-X-ray relationship is about 0.85, which is possibly
consistent with the theoretical prediction from the
accretion-flow-dominated X-ray model. We briefly discuss the reason
why our derived relationship is different from some previous works and
expect the future spectral studies in radio and X-ray bands on
individual sources in our sample to confirm our result.

Our sample is selected from the X-ray-emitting SDSS AGN catalog
(Anderson et al., 2003, Cat. J/AJ/126/2209) and the FIRST 20cm
radio survey1 (White et al., 1997, See Cat. VIII/71).

The Washington Visual Double Star Catalog (WDS) is the successor to
the Index Catalogue of Visual Double Stars, 1961.0 (IDS; Jeffers and
van den Bos, Publ. Lick Obs. 21). Three earlier double star catalogs
in XXth century, those by Burnham (BDS, 1906, "General Catalogue of
Double Stars within 121 degrees of the North Pole", Carnegie
Institution of Washington), Innes (SDS, 1927, "Southern Double Star
Catalogue -19 to -90 degrees", Union Observatory, Johannesburg, South
Africa), and Aitken (ADS, 1932 "New General Catalogue of Double Stars
within 121 degrees of the North Pole", Carnegie Institution of
Washington), each covered only a portion of the sky. Both the IDS and
the WDS cover the entire sky, and the WDS is intended to contain all
known visual double stars for which at least one differential measure
has been published. The WDS is continually updated as published data
become available. Prior to this, three major updates have been
published (Worley and Douglass 1984, "Washington Visual Double Star
Catalog, 1984.0", U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington; Worley and
Douglass 1997A&AS..125..523W, Cat. I/237; Mason, Wycoff, Hartkopf,
Douglass and Worley 2001AJ....122.3466M; and Mason et al. 2006.5).

The Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) has seen numerous changes
since the last major release of the catalog. The application of many
techniques and considerable industry over the past few years has
yielded significant gains in both the number of systems and the number
of measures. Is is maintained by the US Naval Observatory, and
represents the world's principal database of astrometric double and
multiple star information. The WDS contains positions (J2000),
discoverer designations, epochs, position angles, separations,
magnitudes, spectral types, proper motions, and, when available,
Durchmusterung numbers and notes for the components of the systems.

This is the second edition of  the  Catalogue  of  the  Components  of

description has been given in Communication de l'Observatoire Royal de
Belgique, Serie A, 115, 1994,  may be found at the CDS under reference
I/211.  The complete description of this second edition is published
(in French and English) in "Observations et Travaux",  a review edited
by the Societe Astronomique de France. A detailed historical sketch of
the  creation and  development of  the catalogue  --  which  served as
double star data base for  the  preparation  of  the  HIpparcos  Input
Catalogue I/196 --  has been published in issue 25,  pp.29-31 (1999)
of this same review.

There are no fundamental differences between the two editions: format,
presentation and construction are similar. The main difference lies in
the important increase of  the  considered  systems  of  which  number
expands from 34.031 to 49.325.  Few additions exist in the description
of  the contents of the various columns,  and some new codes had to be
used  for references to astronomical positions,  especially related to
the introduction of new  Hipparcos  systems  or  components  to  known
systems (see  the  "refpos.dat" file).   Concerning  the names  of the
systems in columns 16 to 22, one has also to mention some additions to
those given in the INDEX-WDS (C.E.Worley, 1984).

The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia[1] is an astronomy website, founded in Paris, France by Jean Schneider in February 1995, which maintains a database of all the currently known and candidate extrasolar planets, with individual "note" pages for each planet and a full list interactive catalog spreadsheet. The main catalogue comprises databases of all of the currently confirmed extrasolar planets as well as a database of unconfirmed planet detections. The databases are frequently updated with new data from peer-reviewed publications and conferences.

In their respective pages, the Planets are listed along with their basic properties such as the year of planets discovery, mass, radius, orbital period, semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of periastron, time of periastron, maximum time variation, and time of transit, including all error range values.

The interactive catalog that lists all of the data together in spreadsheet format does not contain error value ranges. It is important to note this failing as anyone who strictly goes by the interactive catalog spreadsheet version might miss the wide range of error on many of the planet's individual data page. For example, planet GQ Lup b is listed as a 21.5 Jupiter mass object when it is in fact anywhere from (±20.5) a 1.0 Jupiter mass object to a 42 Jupiter mass object. The individual planet data pages also contain the data on the parent star such as Name, Distance (pc), Spectral Type, Effective Temperature, Apparent Magnitude V, Mass, Radius , Age, Right Asc. Coord., Decl. Coord.
Even when they are known, not all of these figures are listed in the interactive spreadsheet catalog. And many missing planet figures that would simply require the application of Kepler's third law of motion are left blank. Most notably absent on all pages is the star's luminosity.

astorb.dat is an  ASCII  file  of  high-precision  osculating  orbital
elements, ephemeris uncertainties,  and some  additional data  for all
the numbered  asteroids and the vast  majority of unnumbered asteroids
(multi-apparition  and single-apparition) for which  it is possible to
make reasonably determinate computations.  It  contains  30769  orbits
computed  by the author. Each orbit, based on astrometric observations
downloaded from the  Minor  Planet  Center,  occupies  one  264-column
record.

The research  and computing needed to  generate astorb.dat were funded
principally by NASA grant  NAGW-1470,   and  in  part  by  the  Lowell
Observatory  endowment.  astorb.dat may be  freely used,  copied,  and
transmitted  provided  attribution  to  Dr.   Edward  Bowell  and  the
aforementioned funding  sources is made.  Hypertext  links to this WWW
