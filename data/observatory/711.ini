The McDonald Observatory is an astronomical observatory located near the unincorporated community of Fort Davis in Jeff Davis County, Texas, United States. The facility is located on Mount Fowlkes and Mount Locke in the Davis Mountains of West Texas.[1]

The site is campus property of the University of Texas at Austin and receives its main funding from the university. The observatory is equipped with a wide range of instrumentation for imaging and spectroscopy in the optical and infrared spectra and operates the first lunar laser ranging station. McDonald works closely with the astronomy department of the University of Texas at Austin while maintaining administrative autonomy. The McDonald Observatory also produces and consults on StarDate, a daily syndicated radio astronomy segment hosted by Sandy Wood that airs on stations throughout the United States in both English and Spanish.

The Otto Struve Telescope and the Harlan J. Smith Telescope are located on Mount Locke at an altitude of 6,791 ft/2,070 m. The Hobby-Eberly Telescope, dedicated in late 1997, is located on the summit of Mount Fowlkes at 6,659 ft/2,030 m above sea level. The high and dry peaks of the Davis Mountains make for some of the darkest and clearest night skies in the region and provide excellent conditions for astronomical research.
