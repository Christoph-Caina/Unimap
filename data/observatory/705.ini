The Apache Point Observatory is located in the Sacramento Mountains in Sunspot, New Mexico (USA) 18 miles south of Cloudcroft. The observatory consists of the Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-meter telescope, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 2.5-m telescope with a 20" photometric telescope, and New Mexico State University's 1.0-m telescope. Access to the telescopes and buildings is restricted, but the public is welcomed to stroll the grounds. The visitor's center at Sun Spot (the National Solar Observatory) includes a model of Apache Point's 3.5 meter telescope and actual filter plates for the Sloan telescope.

The 3.5 m telescope hosts the APOLLO lunar-ranging project. The APOLLO laser has been operational since October 2005, and routinely accomplishes millimeter-level range accuracy between the earth and the moon.

Observations at APO are often carried out remotely by observers using TUI, the Telescope User Interface, via the internet.
