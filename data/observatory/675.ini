Palomar Observatory [1], at approximately 5,570 ft elevation, is a privately owned observatory located in San Diego County, California, 90 miles (145 km) southeast of Pasadena's Mount Wilson Observatory, in the Palomar Mountain Range. It is owned and operated by the California Institute of Technology. Research time is granted to Caltech and its research partners which includes the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Cornell University.[1]. The observatory currently consists of three large telescopes: the 200 inch (5.08 m) Hale telescope, the 48 inch (1.22 m) Samuel Oschin telescope, and a 60 inch (1.52 m) reflecting telescope. In addition, the Palomar Testbed Interferometer and other instruments are located at this observatory. An 18 inch (457 millimeter) Schmidt telescope, Palomar Observatory's first telescope, dating from 1936, is no longer operational.
