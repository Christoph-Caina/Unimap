Mount Graham International Observatory (MGIO) is a division of Steward Observatory the research arm for the Department of Astronomy at The University of Arizona. It is located in southeast Arizona's Pinaleno Mountains near Mount Graham. Scientific researchers from around the world make use of the MGIO facilities.

Construction of MGIO began in 1989. MGIO currently operates and maintains facilities for three scientific organizations. The first two telescopes, the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope and the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope began operations in 1993. The Large Binocular Telescope, one of the world's largest and most powerful telescopes, is being commissioned at this time.

Public tours of the MGIO are conducted by the Eastern Arizona College's (EAC) Discovery Park Campus. Weather permitting tours are allowed between mid-April and mid-November. Reservations and permits must be obtained through EAC's Discovery Park Campus.
