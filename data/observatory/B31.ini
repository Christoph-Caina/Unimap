South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) is the national center for optical infrared astronomy in South Africa. It was established in 1972. The observatory is run by South Africa's National Research Foundation. The facility's function is to conduct research in astronomy and astrophysics. The primary telescopes are located in Sutherland, which is a four hour drive from Observatory, Cape Town, which is where the headquarters is located. The SAAO has international links worldwide that exchange scientific and technological collaboration. Contributions from the South African Astronomical Observatory to the science field include the development of a spherical aberration corrector and the Southern African Large Telescope, otherwise known as SALT, which was inaugurated in November 2005. Much research as been done with the telescope including investigation of black holes and polar stars.
